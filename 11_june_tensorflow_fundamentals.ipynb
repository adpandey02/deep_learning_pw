    "Q1: What are the different data structures used in TensorFlow? Give some examples.\n",
    "A1: TensorFlow uses tensors as the main data structure. Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays used to represent and perform computations on data. There are three commonly used types of tensors in TensorFlow:\n",
    "Scalar: A scalar tensor represents a single value, such as a number or a constant.\n",
    "Vector: A vector tensor represents a one-dimensional array of values. It can be thought of as a list of numbers.\n",
    "Matrix: A matrix tensor represents a two-dimensional array of values, arranged in rows and columns.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Scalar: 3, 2.5, -1\n",
    "Vector: [1, 2, 3], [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5]\n",
    "Matrix: [[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[0.5, 1.5, 2.5], [-1, 0, 1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: How does the TensorFlow constant differ from a TensorFlow variable? Explain with an example.\n",
    "A2: In TensorFlow, a constant is a type of tensor whose value cannot be changed once it is defined. It is used to represent fixed values that remain constant throughout the execution of a program. Constants are typically used to define model parameters or fixed inputs.\n",
    "On the other hand, a variable is a type of tensor whose value can be modified during the execution of a program. Variables are used to represent trainable parameters, such as the weights and biases in a neural network. They can be updated and optimized during the training process.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "a = tf.constant(2)\n",
    "b = tf.constant(3)\n",
    "c = a + b\n",
    "x = tf.Variable(5)\n",
    "y = tf.Variable(10)\n",
    "z = x * y\n",
    "In the above example, a and b are constants with fixed values, while x and y are variables that can be modified. The constant c\n",
    "represents the sum of a and b, which is computed once and remains unchanged. The variable z represents the product of x and y, which can\n",
    "be modified and updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Describe the process of matrix addition, multiplication, and element-wise operations in TensorFlow.\n",
    "A3:Matrix Addition: In TensorFlow, matrix addition can be performed using the tf.add() function or the + operator. It adds corresponding elements of two matrices together. The matrices must have the same dimensions.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "A = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "B = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "C = tf.add(A, B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Multiplication: Matrix multiplication in TensorFlow can be performed using the tf.matmul() function or the @ operator. It computes the dot product of two matrices. The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "A = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "B = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "D = tf.matmul(A, B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Element-wise Operations: Element-wise operations perform operations on corresponding elements of two matrices or tensors. TensorFlow provides various element-wise operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, etc. These operations are applied independently to each element of the matrices.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "A = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "B = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "# Element-wise add\n",
    "D = tf.add(A, B)\n",
    "# Element-wise multiplication\n",
    "E = tf.multiply(A, B)\n",
    "# Element-wise division\n",
    "F = tf.divide(A, B\n",
    "# Element-wise exponentiation\n",
    "G = tf.pow(A, B)\n",
